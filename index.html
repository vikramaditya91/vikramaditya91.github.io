Hi! I work as with software development (python, C++), DevOps (Jenkins, GitLab) and middleware for NUMECA Intl in Brussels, Belgium.
I am quality focussed and dabble in many things computer science but Python takes the cake.

<br>
In spite of the fact that I loved computers ever since I was introduced to MS-DOS in third grade, I chose fluid dynamics engineering in uni.
I realized quite early in my career that my true potential lies in working with computers rather than making simulations around a car.
My first job combined fluid dynamics and scripting and currently my second job is completely about computers and I have not looked back.

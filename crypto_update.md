<b>You start the challenge with 10 ETH. The objective is to maximize the ETH by making any number of trades.</b>

1. The vigilant_crypto bot spits out the coins with the highest potential.
2. If unutilized ETH is available, buy the potential coins at market value and set a sell-order for 5% profits.
3. If the coin does not reach the sell-target within 20 days, sell the coin at market price.

Disclaimer:
Note that this is only a simulation. Although the price of the alt-coins are taken directly from the Binance API, the trades were not actually executed as this is still not ready for production.
Trading with crypto-currencies is considered speculative due to its volatile nature, and should be exercised with the utmost degree of caution.
